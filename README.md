# TrajectoryEstimation
Fast trajectory MAP and its corresponding application in path planning and visual tracking

Many previous works on trajectory estimation strongly rely on prior information. Thus, they are sensitive to disturbances such as model error, observation drift, statistical deviations and nonlinearity. Here an online adaptive optimization (OAO) algorithm is proposed to address these disturbances. First, a damped power turn (DPT) model following Newtonian mechanics is introduced, and a discrete-time model is derived to describe motion with limited power. This technique avoids the infinite velocity in the linear dynamic model. Then, the trajectory is optimized by the maximum posteriori estimation under regional correlations. To correct for errors in the prior information and improve the robustness of the algorithm, the transition and observation covariances are updated online based on a fading memory strategy and error analysis. In addition, a truncation approach is used to improve the computational efficiency, therein adaptively limiting the total time consumption.
